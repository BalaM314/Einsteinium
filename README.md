# Einsteinium
A tool to help you build Nuclearcraft fission reactors. Currently in beta, in-app instructions coming soon.

## What is this?
This is a tool to help you create designs for nuclear fission reactors, in a version of the block game called Minecraft modified with Nuclearcraft. It's more complicated than it seems. Different coolers have different rules for placement, some fuels generate more heat than others, and you want to generate as much power as possible without causing a Chernobyl.
